Hello! I am Harsh Doshi.

I'm joining the University of Pennsylvania in Fall 2025 to pursue my Master’s in Computer Science. Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Salesforce for two years. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, Goa Campus.

At Salesforce, I worked in the domain of software security - threat and vulnerability management. I scanned vulnerabilities and bugs for breakfast, deployed defenders for lunch, monitored health of systems and services for dinner and had a good night sleep knowing that Salesforce assets are secured to the highest level.

This website is my personal journal, a repository of my daily insights and discoveries as I relentlessly strive to level up as a software engineer. Expect these blog posts to be raw, unpolished—more like my short notes, capturing moments of my continuous learning journey. Also, a crazier way to think about this is that this webpage is my immoratility, I won't be there some day, but this page will continue to exist.

Life goals: 
1. Keep learning continuously
2. Be a high agency person
3. Make people around me happier, all the time!
