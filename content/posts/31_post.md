The nature of my work requires me to do devops stuff as well and YAML is an integral part of it. I would rather say, I have had more PRs in YAML than in any other coding language. YAML is a fairly easy, human-readable data-serialization language. I have used it extensively for configurations of pipelines, dockerfiles, aws-environments, etc. Let's go over what makes a YAML file.

1. Key-Value Pairs:
```
fruit: apple 
dessert: "apple pie"
```

In case that there is a whitespace in the value, wrap it up inside inverted commas.


2. Arrays/Lists:

Each Key has multiple Values. Order matters:

```
Drinks: 
      - Smoothie
      - "Sparkling Water" 
```
This is basically: `Drinks = [Smoothie, Sparkling Water]`

3. Directories/Maps:

There are Key-Value pairs for each Key. Order doesn't matter.


```
Burger:
    Calories: 500
    Price: 15
```

This is basically: `Burger = [Calories --> 500, Price --> 15]`


4. Spacing matters in YAML! Keep it consistent.
