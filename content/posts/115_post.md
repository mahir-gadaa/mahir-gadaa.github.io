1. We write to complement our thinking, we write to think better. Readers however, read with a different language patterns, with different mindset even though they are experts in the same domain. This causes an interference. The most important thing of your writing should be that it must be _Valuable_. 
2. It is so much about the readers and less about the content. For e.g., The content you have written is about AI catching software bugs and let's say you are giving it to a humanities professor to read. The interference is maximum! Hence, before writing, first you have to stop and think about the readers.
3. Writing is not communicating your ideas to your readers -- it is changing their ideas.
4. Writing is not just creating knowledge. It is creating knowledge that people care about. Domain knowledge can be thought of as a common discourse agreed by a certain set of people, the goal of your writing is pushing this forward. What writing is not: Building on a linear model of, we know about 'X' so this is 'X+1' that I am proposing. Rather it should be that you challenge 'X' and propose 'X+Y'.
