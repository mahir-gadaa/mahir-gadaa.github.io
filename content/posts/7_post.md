Ideas for my digital space.

I want to create a digital space for myself. It needs to have the following charactersitics:

1. It should have animation of a guy (who resembles me) sitting at a desk and working at the laptop. Something like the Lo-fi girl. At the table there has to be some books and a coffee cup that's hot.

2. There should be a cat that's running around the webpage, is sleeping and doing cat things.

3. Outside the window, there should be day or night depending upon the time it is in Mumbai. Same with the weathter. If it is raining then it should rain. 

4. There should be a poster of Dallas Mavericks, Salesforce and Flag of India.
